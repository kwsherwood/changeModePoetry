# changeModePoetry
Change Mode Poetry A Pedagogical Project to develop workshops and code snippets promoting the adoption of an exploratory programming dimension for HS and College English classes. 

Overview
==============

Change Mode Poetry recognizes the extraordinary achievements of Processing in opening doors of code literacy within Fine Arts curricula and seeks to contribute to opening the doors on a parallel process for English pedagogy within high school and college classrooms. 

The main work of Change Mode Poetry will be the development of introductory workshops and a pool of code-snippets. Workshops will be accessible for teachers with minimal programming background  and aligned with learning goals of English curricula in American HS and university classes. As a complement to the existing introductory and intermediate resources in  book, tutorial, and video formats(McCarthy, Reas, Fry, Schiffman), the workshops will allow teachers to implement exploratory lesson plans that enrich the teaching of reading and writing by enabling students to manipulate, analyze, visualize, and compose through the manipulation of code in the P5.js environment.
